<h3>Project description: </h3>

This is an on-going personal project where I'm reproducing the open source [Tinymal project](https://tinymal.cn/), which provides me with an opportunity to keep me practising my hardware skills (e.g. Solidworks, KiCAD, 3D printing, soldering, Microcontroller programming etc.).

I'm planning on integrating some custom designed part at a later date, and hopefully implement some generative design ideas to improve the design (e.g. using generative models to auto optimise/design mechanical part and linkage arrangements etc.).
