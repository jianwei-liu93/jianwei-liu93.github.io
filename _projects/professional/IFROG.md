<h3>Project description: </h3>

The project aims to develop a team of magnetic based amphibious robots capable of working in teams to clean and inspect monopiles above water level and up to 60 metres below.

Teams of iFROG robots will be able to clean corrosion and biofouling from monopiles, before inspecting the surfaces and conducting pre-emptive checks of weld integrity. The technology is also expected to find markets beyond the offshore wind industry by targeting the oil and gas sector, ship hull manufacturing and maintenance, military, and other large-structure related industries.
