<h3>Project description: </h3>

RADBLAD is a robot system designed to carry out an X-ray maintenance survey of wind turbines offshore and onshore. At present wind turbines, surveys are carried out manually by maintenance engineers climbing the wind turbine and its blades with rope access. The RADBLAD system aims use radiographic based in-situ inspection, automatic detection of defects using an AI (artificial intelligent) based software, and a modular magnetic climbing robotic system to perform efficient early detection of blade (internal) defects whilst reducing the risk to human maintenance engineers.
