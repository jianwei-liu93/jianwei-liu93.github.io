<h3>Project description: </h3>

Ultrasonic NDT inspectors are currently trained on sample workpieces containing actual or machined flaws. These workpieces are heavy and relatively few in number, causing major logistical challenges
for training schools. TrainNDT aims to address this by developing an inexpensive system using replica workpieces and a probe tracking system. This system locates the probe with respect to the workpiece, 
and displays an A-scan waveform on-screen as if a real workpiece were being scanned.

Existing NDT tracking systems typically use draw-wire encoders to track the probe, however these are cumbersome and affect the operator's scanning ability, making them ill-suited to training applications. 
TrainNDT has been developed using visual based tracking to minimise user impact.
