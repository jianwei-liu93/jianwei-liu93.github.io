<h3>Project description: </h3>

RoBFMS is an automated cleaning platform for offshore monopile wind turbines. The project uses a machine learning-based visual inspection system to identify biofouling growth on the external face of the offshore wind turbine monopile foundations, then use an ultrasonic cleaning system to remove growth. This prevents damage from long-term biofouling accumulation. These systems are mounted on a magnetic based robotic crawler which is deployed above water on the turbine tower and then moves itself below sea level to begin cleaning. Advantages over existing systems are that a surface crawler is cheaper than existing ROV systems and is less hazardous than sending human divers.
