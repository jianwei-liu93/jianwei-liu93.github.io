<h3>Project description: </h3>

The COSCR project aims to bring a novel solution to the construction industry – a fully autonomous mobile robot with an integrated lifter and robotic arm able to perform works at height, especially drilling holes in the underside of concrete floor slabs to enable fixings for services and suspended ceilings. This is repetitive, labour intensive task has significant H&S implications for workers and presents a significant, global market for robotic solutions.

In addition to this the project aims to be able to safely work in close proximity with humans in a dynamic environment as well as link to BIM (Building Information Modelling) system to enable autonomous working directly from CAD.
