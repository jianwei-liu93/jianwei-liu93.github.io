I am an experienced roboticist and currently a PhD student (Sep. 2022 - 2026), working with [Prof. Dimitrios Kanoulas](https://dkanou.github.io/) at the [RPL lab](https://rpl-as-ucl.github.io/) and the [Foundational AI CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/foundational-ai-cdt/people/student-profiles) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). My current research direction involves utilising Generative ML models (e.g. diffusion models) and Neuromorphic learning for planning for legged robots. I'm also interested in exploring topics such as continual learning and open-endness.

Prior to starting the PhD, I obtained a MEng in Biomedical Engineering from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), a MSc in Robotics and Computation from UCL, and worked in industry as a robotics software engineer on off-shore NDT inspection robots and construction robots (see past projects [here](/projects/)).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
